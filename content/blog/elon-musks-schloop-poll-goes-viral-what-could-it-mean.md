Musk's poll quickly went viral, with over 2 million votes cast in a matter of hours. The results were overwhelmingly in favor of the "schloop," with over 75% of respondents expressing interest in the unit of measurement.

Many were surprised by the sudden appearance of the "schloop" poll, as it seemed to come out of nowhere. However, Musk is known for his unconventional approach to marketing and product development, and it's likely that the poll was simply a way for him to gauge interest in a potential new offering.

While it's unclear at this time what exactly the "schloop" might be used for, or even if it will ever see the light of day, it's clear that Musk has a knack for generating buzz and engagement on social media. Regardless of the outcome, it's likely that this won't be the last time Musk uses Twitter to gauge interest in one of his ideas.
