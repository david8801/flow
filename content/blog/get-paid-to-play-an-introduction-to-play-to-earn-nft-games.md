## What is NFT?

Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are a relatively new concept in the world of blockchain technology. They're digital assets that can be bought, sold, and traded like physical items, but because they're digital, they can be used in a variety of ways that weren't possible before.

One of the most exciting applications of NFTs is in the world of play-to-earn games, also known as P2P games. These are games where players can earn real-world money by playing and having fun. The key element here is that the in-game items they earn are non-fungible tokens, which can be bought and sold on the open market.

**An example of a play-to-earn NFT game is SandBox**, a virtual world where players can create, share, and monetize their own experiences using NFTs. In SandBox, players can earn NFTs by completing in-game tasks, such as building their own virtual worlds. They can then sell these NFTs to other players for real money.

> NFTs can also be used for other purposes as well, such as representing a piece of digital art, a collectible card, or even a tweet!

It's important to note that because NFTs can be bought and sold on the open market, their value can fluctuate widely. Some NFTs have sold for millions of dollars, while others may be worth only a few cents. As with any investment, it's important to do your research and understand the risks before buying or selling NFTs.
