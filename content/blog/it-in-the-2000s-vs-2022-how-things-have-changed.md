1. Cloud computing: Back in the early 2000s, cloud computing was just starting to become a thing. Nowadays, it's a mainstream technology that pretty much every organization uses to store and process data.
2. Mobile devices: Back in the day, mobile phones were mostly just used for calling and texting. These days, smartphones are like tiny computers that can access the internet, run apps, and do all sorts of things.
3. Artificial intelligence: AI has been around for a while, but it's really taken off in recent years. From virtual assistants to self-driving cars, AI is showing up all over the place.
4. Internet of Things (IoT): The IoT is all about connecting everyday objects to the internet so they can communicate and exchange data. While the concept of the IoT has been around for a while, it's really taken off in recent years, with more and more devices getting connected.
5. Cybersecurity: With the internet being such a big part of our lives, cybersecurity is more important than ever. From data breaches to ransomware attacks, it's a top concern for organizations and individuals alike.

In short, IT trends have come a long way in the past 20 years. From the rise of cloud computing and mobile devices to the growth of AI and the IoT, these trends are changing the way we live and work in the 21st century.
