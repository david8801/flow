## What is Bank Of Memories?

[Bank of Memories](https://bankofmemories.org/) is a web3 platform that leverages crypto-primitives and new forms of engagement with web3 to create a safe space for family units to interact and build out their family tree. Users can earn $GBM tokens for growing their family tree, which can then be used to access all the services the platform provides.

Bank of Memories is a clean, transparent, private vehicle for family – and other close groups – to congregate and interact with one another, away from the prying public eyes and brutal noise of traditional social media. Families can create NFTs and store them in the family vault. They can also create access NFTs that signify one belongs to a family unit, which then grants access to everything in the family vault.

Users will be able to send time-capsuled memories containing unique crypto gifts to one another and create memories that exist forever on the blockchain. They can store, send, and pass on crypto to their family too. Vaults are maintained by a distributed data storage system that stops any central point of failure.

## What Does $GBM Token Do?

$GBM is the native token of the Global Bank of Memories network. The network supervises and maintains all of the family vaults, It will be connected to multiple different blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and more. $GBM pays for all services on the network and confers privileges to holders.

$GBM holders can vote on network governance issues, NFT minting fees, and deciding which bridges to add to the network. Bank of Memories will allow $GBM to be used for liquidity for bridges, securing the long-term health of the ecosystem and perpetuating interoperability and growth.

Users can also participate in Family Fund Staking. With this, users can stake $GBM and let everyone in their family use Bank of Memories for free. They will also generate yield for betting that can be used to pay for all of Bank of Memories storage services.

55% of the entire $GBM supply will be available to early users. This is significantly more than comparable projects. Bank of Memories believes in true decentralization and wants to put the value of the ecosystem directly into the hands of the families that make it what it is. Distribution for this tranche of the token will happen in numerous ways, chief among them giving users $GBM tokens directly for growing their family tree and referring new users to the platform, as well as incentives for setting up family vaults, and even a registration bonus for the first wave of adopters.

## Creating Heritage on the Blockchain

Bank of Memories opens up an opportunity for true heritage to exist on the blockchain. Memories can be passed down the blockchain, as can the complete history of a family unit's social interaction in this safe space. No centralized entity responsible for the file storage will ever go bust, and no server will go down or be removed that holds the important data. The data is distributed in a decentralized fashion and can never be lost. Bank of Memories will hold precious memories for eternity, for children and great-grandchildren to see long into the future.

Thinking about such long-term goals isn’t necessarily standard in crypto, and it’s a testament to what Bank of Memories is trying to achieve that they take the long view. It shows their faith in DLT as the crucible of our future interaction in society, and that a decentralized system is simply a better way to run the world that eventually everyone will embrace. A crucial part of those systems involves heritage, and how we hand down what matters to us to those we leave behind.

Bank of Memories is first, of course, focusing on the private moments between families that only they can cherish. Yet in time, as NFTs begin to be used in more real-world systems like real estate, safe storage of that property will become paramount. Bank of Memories provides a way for users to secure these real-world value NFTs in perpetuity and grant access only to their family, or precious few around them, who they would want to be the beneficiaries when they pass.
